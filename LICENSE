The first edition of this book was based on a late
draft of the ANSI standard for C and is copyright Mike
Banahan. This online version is a reproduction of the second edition
based on the published ANSI standard. The second edition was published
in 1991, copyright Mike Banahan, Declan Brady and Mark Doran. By
agreement with Declan Brady and Mark Doran, copyright in this online
version and derived works is copyright Mike Banahan, 2003. The print
versions were published by Addison Wesley.

This online version is derived from files in Unix nroff format
discovered on a floppy disk just prior to a move of
offices by GBdirect Ltd. It is believed that the files were
were used by the publishers Addison Wesley in the preparation of
the second print edition and that some amendments or corrections may
have been made in the print version that are not reflected
in this online version. The online version was prepared with the
assistance of some Perl scripts written by Mike Banahan, by Steve
King, who cleaned up the output of the Perl scripts and
also by sterling work by Geoff Richards and Aaron Crane who
performed magic with XSLT to produce the HTML documents.

The publication of the online version is for historical interest and
readers are warned that it should be treated as an historical
document. There is now a later standard for the C programming
language and this publication cannot be considered current: whilst for the
most part the current and the first standard are very close,
some substantive changes and extensions have occurred since 1991. NO WARRANTY
IS OFFERED AS TO THE COMPLETENESS OR ACCURACY OF THE MATERIAL.

prohibited by law, in which case fawning and flattery may be substituted.)
